# LaunchPad
LaunchPad is a new application from [Noah Osterhout](https://noahosterhout.com) that allows Development Teams to have all of their files, tasks, ToDo, etc all in one place.

### LaunchPad Info
LaunchPad is still in *very* early development.  I don't know if it'll take off or what features are to come.  Stay tuned!
LaunchPad is also using the MIT License and is free for now.  This project may be taken private whenever I want, with/out warning.
